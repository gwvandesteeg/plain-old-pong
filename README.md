# Plain Old Pong
This project is a first attempt to create a game using Unity using 3D
objects whilst giving the game the look and feel of a 2D game.  The
game supports both a single player and two-player aspect.

To ensure the games don't last forever a ball in play periodically
accellerates after contacting a players paddle.  In addition the
game play has been altered so that the ball is not always launched
towards the first player, but the launch direction is controlled
by the players by being directed away from the first player to press
the launch key.  This should give the player in single player mode
the most control since they are the only one capable of launching
the ball.

This project is a building block for people new to learning Unity and
C# (as I am) to get their feet wet and have a simple example of how
things could be done, this does not neccesarily make it the correct
approach but how it worked for me.

## Documentation
The project includes material for documentation generation (using
doxygen and javadoc style comments, because documentation should
be human readable first and not machine readable first).

## Unit tests
Where feasible unit tests for code will be provided using the Unity
recommended NUnit testing system.

## Integration tests
Where feasible integration tests for code will be provided using the
Unity Test Tools asset from the Unity asset store.  Code from this is
released under its own license and will be noted as such.
