# Plain Old Pong
Is a first attempt to create a game using Unity using 3D objects whilst
giving the game the look and feel of a 2D game.  The game supports both
a single player and two-player aspect.

To ensure the games don't last forever a ball in play periodically
accellerates after contacting a players paddle.  In addition the
game play has been altered so that the ball is not always launched
towards the first player, but the launch direction is controlled
by the players by being directed away from the first player to press
the launch key.  This should give the player in single player mode
the most control since they are the only one capable of launching
the ball.
